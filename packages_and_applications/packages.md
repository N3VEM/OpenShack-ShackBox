# OpenShack-ShackBox

In the N3VEM hamshack, the "shackBox" is the primary daily use shack computer.  Below are the packages and any pertinent installation notes. 


From a terminal always begin with
```
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrage
```

## Barrier
I have multiple computers (not all for shack purposes) and use a 'software KVM' so that one mouse and keyboard can be used across all of them, like one large continuous desktop.
I currently use [Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) for this purpose.
