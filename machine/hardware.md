# OpenShack-ShackBox

In the N3VEM hamshack, the "shackBox" is the main daily use computer, and the one that the main rigs are/will be connected to.

The computer currently in use is an Acer Aspire X1920.  This is an 'older' PC, but it is plenty capable for daily use in the shack.
They can generally be found on ebay for under $200.

  - Pentium Dual-Core CPU E6700 @ 3.2GHz

There is currenlty no 'extras' or 'upgraded' hardward - this PC is 'off the shelf.'
