# OpenShack-ShackBox

In the N3VEM hamshack, the "shackBox" is currently running Linux Mint 20 'Uma' with the Cinnamon desktop.

the iso for creating an install disk/meida [is available here](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php)

For my installation, I burned the image to an SD Card with a USB adapter.

On Boot, choose "Start Mint" from the menu.  This will put you in live DVD mode, where you can poke around and see what using Mint is like.
When ready, click the "Install Linux Mint" icon on the desktop to install the OS to your computer.

Follow the prompts - there aren't many.  Below are my settings I entered as prompted:

Language - English

Keyboard Layout - English (US)

Install Multimedia codecs - yes (checked)

Installation Type - Erase disk and install linux Mint

Time Zone - New York

Your Name - Name Goes Here

Your computer's name - Pick a name for your computer

Pick a username - Pick a username

Choose a password - Pick a password

check log in automatically if desired

After this, the install will run.  It should only take a few minutes.

Reboot when done.

On first boot, I reccomend walking through the various setup steps that the system prompts you to do (setting up snapshots, preferences, etc.)
