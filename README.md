# OpenShack-ShackBox
Part of the larger OpenShack project, this repository focuses on custom code/scripts written to be used on a stations "daily use" (i.e. logging) machine.

This repository will be broken up into appropriate sections, which are likely to change over time as needs require.

Currently:

# Machine
This section will give details on the hardware for the ShackBox is running on

# OS
This section will give details on the operating system for the ShackBox

# Services
This section will contain details on custom system services set up to run on the shackbox

If you happen to have an FTDX3000, and have had trouble with it 'changing' serial port numbers, make sure to [check out the info on creating a udev rule](https://github.com/N3VEM/OpenShack-ShackBox/blob/master/services/udev_rules.md) to deal with that. 

# More to come
More sections will be added as needed
