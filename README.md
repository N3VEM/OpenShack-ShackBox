# OpenShack-ShackBox
Part of the larger OpenShack project, this repository focuses on custom code/scripts written to be used on a stations "daily use" (i.e. logging) machine.

This repository will be broken up into appropriate sections, which are likely to change over time as needs require.

Currently:

# Machine
This section will give details on the hardware for the ShackBox is running on

# OS
This section will give details on the operating system for the ShackBox

# Services
This section will contain details on custom system services set up to run on the shackbox

# More to come
More sections will be added as needed
